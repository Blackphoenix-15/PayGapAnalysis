#Gender Pay Gap Analysis Tool
Overview
The Gender Pay Gap Analysis Tool is designed to help organizations identify, analyze, and address gender-based pay disparities. It provides actionable feedback to HR departments to improve pay equity and ensure fair compensation practices within the company.

#How It Works
Data Upload: Companies upload their employee datasets, including key features such as gender, salary, tenure, promotion status, and performance metrics.

Data Processing: The model processes this data to identify pay disparities based on gender and other factors like seniority, job role, and time spent at the company.

#Data Aggregation:

The tool is trained on aggregated, anonymized data from multiple companies, ensuring privacy while generating more generalizable insights.
It allows companies to benchmark their pay practices against industry standards.
